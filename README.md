Uturi is a set of accessibility tools and libraries that give people with disabilities greater autonomy and access to information. The name "Uturi" comes from the Korean folktale "Baby General Uturi" (아기장수 우투리), where Uturi overcomes disabilities and becomes a hero who fights for the weak.

## 🎯 Mission

Our mission is to make the digital world more inclusive for people with disabilities.

We do this by:
- Providing developers with high-quality accessibility libraries
- Helping applications become truly usable by everyone, regardless of ability
- Reducing accessibility barriers through practical, well-designed tools

## 🌍 Vision

We envision a world where no one is excluded from digital experiences —  
a world where accessibility is not a feature, but a foundation.

Uturi strives to:
- Make inclusive design the default, not the exception  
- Bridge the gap between standards and real-world usability  
- Build a community that values empathy, ethics, and equal access
